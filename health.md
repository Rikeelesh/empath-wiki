Emapths have energy systems that are easily affected by the outside world. Most empaths struggle with overwhelm. This section aims to provide a comprehensive resource for empaths to be able to heal, protect and clear shitty energy from their system.

1. healing - issues within an empath that persist. This sub section focuses on healing more stubborn and chronic issues.
2. protection - how to proactively shield and protect our energy system to prevent issues getting to us in the first place
3. [clearing](/health/clearing) - empaths are constantly processing the energy systems of the world around them. Being able to quickly and effectively clear toxic energies as they try and attach to us helps keep more insidious issues from happening.
