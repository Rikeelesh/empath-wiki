# THE NEUROLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE: THE MIRROR NEURONS

> Mirror neurons allow us to feel into other people not through conceptual reasoning but direct neurological activities. These cells create a neuro-physical link between us and other people, so when we observe someone else doing something, the same regions in our brain which would’ve been involved become activated.  Empathy happens when this applies to our feelings: just seeing another person’s emotions would automatically activate the same somatic responses in us (Anders et al., 2011; Gallese and Goldman, 1998; Goldman and Sripada, 2005; Keysers and Gazzola, 2010). Scientists also refer to this phenomenon as ‘neural resonance’ or ‘brain-to-brain coupling’  (Anders et al., 2011; Jackson et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2006b; Keysers and Gazzola, 2009; Lloyd et al., 2004; Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2009).  Mirror neurons are present in us from birth; we know this when we see one crying infant setting off a wave of crying in a hospital ward.

> The mirror neurons system can be over or under-active, depending on a myriad of factors (Mbemba, Marte & Christian, 2007).   One extreme example of having an overactive mirror system is a condition known as ‘mirror-touch synesthesia’. Synesthesia is where sensations that normally are experienced separately get blended. In mirror-touch synesthesia, when another person gets touched, the synaesthete feels a touch on their body.  On the other end of the spectrum, some suggest that under-activity of the mirror neuron system is linked to autism.
