<!-- TITLE: Boundaries -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: One of the most important things every empath should learn and practice -->

# What do boundaries feel like?
- It is not my job to fix others.
- It is okay if others get angry.
- It is okay to say no.
- It is not my job to take responsibility for others.
- I do not have to anticipate the needs of others.
- It is my job to make me happy.
- I have a right to my own feelings.
- I am enough.
