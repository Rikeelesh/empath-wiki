<!-- TITLE: Myers Briggs Personality Types -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Test results for empaths -->

## What is this?

Carl. G. Jung developed a theory on [psychological types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Types). You've probably heard of people being called extraverts or introverts.

In the 1920's a lady called Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers developed a model based on each personâ€™s Jungian preferences. That model is called the [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator). There are 16 personality types, and you can read about them [here](https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types).

We were curious if empaths were more likely to be one personality type over another. And so we've started capturing the personality types of those in the group wanting to share.
