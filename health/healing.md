# Signs of unhealed trauma

1. You’re hurting yourself

self-harm, cutting, drug abuse, overwork

2. You’re hurting others, or lashing out with anger when you least expect it.

“Hurt people hurt people.” aka projection

3. You’re struggling with depression, anxiety, or another serious mental health concern

Depression is anger turned inward. Anxiety is what happens when we cut ourselves off from our feelings and our energy bounces back and forth between our internal walls.

4. You avoid certain places, objects, or people you used to love, because they trigger terrible feelings.

5. You have significant gaps in your memory, particularly surrounding difficult times.

6. You can’t bear to sit alone in silence

Yet the paradoxical truth is that time in silence can actually help us to heal. Once we learn how to act as our own compassionate witness, we can let our pain arise and also let it go.

7. You have certain “shameful” stories you’d never share with anyone.

The way we stop our shame stories from running our lives is not to bury them further, but rather to share them with a kind, present witness who can help us to offer ourselves compassion and forgiveness. That’s how we rise above the toxic mix of shame and addiction.

8. Your inner dialogue is characterized by harsh criticism.

# Strategies for healing

## Talk to someone

Someone that can just be present and be there for you, without judgement and advice. Just being there for you.

## EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique)

This a technique that uses acupressure to release blocked energies from our system, which in turn release blocked emotions.

### Points

#### The collar bone point

The junction where the sternum (breastbone), collarbone and the first rib meet. This is a very important point and in acupuncture is referred to as K (kidney) 27. To locate it, first place your forefinger on the U-shaped notch at the top of the breastbone (about where a man would knot his tie). From the bottom of the U, move your forefinger down toward the navel 1 inch and then go to the left (or right) 1 inch. This point is referred to as Collar Bone even though it is not on the collarbone (or clavicle) per se.

the K-27 points interact with all of the nine energy systems and our hands are electromagnetically activated, all energetic systems are literally “jump started” by tapping these points.

K 27 Acupressure Points (on both sides) are good for chest congestion, phlegm, coughing, throat spasms, sore throats, shallow breathing, difficult breathing, chest tightness, chest pain, anxiety, agitation and thyroid gland irregularities.K 27 is the master Yu Point; its also the exit point of the kidney meridian.

## Anxiety

Try colouring in :)
## Time

Time does heal. If you're feeling awful, give it a few days before you do anything drastic about it. It's amazing how much can shift from creating some time and space for yourself. Things do pass.
## Crystals

Place a quartz crystal on the energetic wound, relax and lie down and simply let it do it's work for you.

## Journal

Get it out onto paper whatever is going on for you. [Even Eminem used writing instead of therapy](https://youtu.be/Ji5I03sko8s?t=787); "my best therapy is to get stuff out".

## Reflexology

#  9 Strategies To Stop Absorbing Other People’s Illness and Pain 

1. Evaluate. First, ask yourself: Is this symptom or emotion mine or someone else’s? It could be both. If the emotion such as fear or anger is yours, gently confront what’s causing it on your own or with professional help. If it’s not yours, try to pinpoint the obvious generator.
2. Move away. When possible, distance yourself by at least twenty feet from the suspected source. See if you feel relief. Don’t err on the side of not wanting to offend strangers. In a public place, don’t hesitate to change seats if you feel a sense of “dis-ease” imposing on you.
3. Know your vulnerable points. Each of us has a body part that is more vulnerable to absorbing others’ stress. Mine is my gut. Scan your body to determine yours. Is it you neck? Do you get sore throats? Headaches? Bladder infections? At the onset of symptoms in these areas, place your palm there and keep sending loving-kindness to that area to soothe discomfort. For longstanding depression or pain, use this method daily to strengthen yourself. It’s comforting and builds a sense of safety and optimism.
4. Surrender to your breath. If you suspect you are picking up someone else’s symptoms, concentrate on your breath for a few minutes. This is centering and connects you to your power.
5. Practice Guerilla Meditation. To counter emotional or physical distress, act fast and meditate for a few minutes. Do this at home, at work, at parties, or conferences. Or, take refuge in the bathroom. If it’s public, close the stall. Meditate there. Calm yourself. Focus on positivity and love.
6. Set healthy limits and boundaries. Control how much time you spend listening to stressful people, and learn to say “no.” Remember, “no” is a complete sentence.
7. Visualize protection around you. Visualize an envelope of white light around your entire body. Or with extremely toxic people, visualize a fierce black jaguar patrolling and protecting your energy field against intruders.
8. Develop X ray vision. The spaces between the vertebrae in your lower back (lumbar spine) are conducive to eliminating pain from the body. It’s helpful to learn to mindfully direct pain out of these spaces by visualizing it leaving your body. Say goodbye to pain as it blends with the giant energy matrix of life!
9. Take a bath or shower. A quick way to dissolve stress is to immerse yourself in water. My bath is my sanctuary after a busy day. It washes away everything from bus exhaust to long hours of air travel to pesky symptoms I have taken on from others. Soaking in natural mineral springs divinely purifies all that ails.
