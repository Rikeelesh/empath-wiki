## THE PSYCHOPATH - The Mask of Sanity

On whether psycopaths are born that way, or is it a result of trauma in their upbringing?

> Some researchers think that psychopathy is the result of some attachment or bonding difficulty as an infant. Dr. Hare has turned the idea around, after all his years digging into the background of psychopaths. He says: In some children the very failure to bond is a symptom of psychopathy. It is likely that these children lack the capacity to bond readily, and that their lack of attachment is largely the result, not the cause, of psychopathy. In other words: they are born that way and you can't fix them.
