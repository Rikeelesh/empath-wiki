Time does heal. If you're feeling awful, give it a few days before you do anything drastic about it. It's amazing how much can shift from creating some time and space for yourself. Things do pass.
# Crystals

Get it out onto paper whatever is going on for you. [Even Eminem used writing instead of therapy](https://youtu.be/Ji5I03sko8s?t=787); "my best therapy is to get stuff out".
