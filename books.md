## The Art of Loving

I love Erich Fromm's books. He was social psychologist, psychoanalyst, sociologist, humanistic philosopher, and democratic socialist. His books about philosophical and sociological aspects of humanity (freedom, fear, to be and to have, democracy) are fantastic. This book is particularly special because he is not referring to love as romantic relationship (although this is also part of loving and it is including in the book) but what love is for us as human beings and how it represents to us: the love to a higher being, parenthood, brotherhood, community and why loving is an art and why it needs practice and study to be mastered.
