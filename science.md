# THE NEUROLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE: THE MIRROR NEURONS

> Mirror neurons allow us to feel into other people not through conceptual reasoning but direct neurological activities. These cells create a neuro-physical link between us and other people, so when we observe someone else doing something, the same regions in our brain which would’ve been involved become activated.  Empathy happens when this applies to our feelings: just seeing another person’s emotions would automatically activate the same somatic responses in us (Anders et al., 2011; Gallese and Goldman, 1998; Goldman and Sripada, 2005; Keysers and Gazzola, 2010). Scientists also refer to this phenomenon as ‘neural resonance’ or ‘brain-to-brain coupling’  (Anders et al., 2011; Jackson et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2006b; Keysers and Gazzola, 2009; Lloyd et al., 2004; Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2009).  Mirror neurons are present in us from birth; we know this when we see one crying infant setting off a wave of crying in a hospital ward.

> The mirror neurons system can be over or under-active, depending on a myriad of factors (Mbemba, Marte & Christian, 2007).   One extreme example of having an overactive mirror system is a condition known as ‘mirror-touch synesthesia’. Synesthesia is where sensations that normally are experienced separately get blended. In mirror-touch synesthesia, when another person gets touched, the synaesthete feels a touch on their body.  On the other end of the spectrum, some suggest that under-activity of the mirror neuron system is linked to autism.

# THE DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVE
> Individuals who have grown up in chaotic childhood environment might have developed a hyper empathic ability as a way to survive.  In environments that are unpredictable, our brains will adapt by extracting patterns from information (Adolphs, 2001). Children at risks are extremely attuned to the micro changes in others’ energy levels, facial expressions, and tone of voice for self-protection because they have trained themselves to pick up on the earliest, most subtle signals of their caregivers’ outrage, or the bullies’ attack.

> Empathic intuition developed out of a precarious environment is often coupled with sensory high alert and anxiety. This state, known as hyper-vigilance, is a result of the neuro-pathways that have been formed in the brain. The traumatised empaths are wired to constantly scan the environment for anything or anyone that could be a potential threat.  Even realistically, as grown-ups they are no longer facing any danger, whenever there are changes in the atmosphere of a room or the emotional tone of other people, they still have an automatic and visceral fight-or-flight reactions, such as tightening of the chest, increased heartbeat, and a feeling that ‘something ought to be done’. In the long run, such physiological stress could lead to symptoms such as adrenal fatigue, chronic fatigue, and depression.
