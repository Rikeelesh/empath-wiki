## Sense8

The story of Sense8 is about the psychic connection of eight strangers from different cultures and parts of the world. The eight eventually discover they form a cluster of "sensates": human beings who are mentally and emotionally linked, can sense and communicate with each other, and can share their knowledge, language, and skills.

In terms of seeing parallels with empaths, I'd mainly just recommend season 1 to get a feel for how the sensates start discovering their ability to connect with each other. Season 2 seems to have more of a focus on the LGBT community, and a hollywood spin on fighting an organisation that is trying to suppress and wipe out this other species of human (sensates).
