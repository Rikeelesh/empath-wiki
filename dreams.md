# How to interpret dreams
Step 1: describe your dream in most detail as you can. if anything stuck out to you in the dream, make sure you write that down too
Step 2:  make a list of concepts in the dream and write down the first thing you think of when you see the concept, not related to your dream. For instance:  walking pass by, ex-girlfriend, get your attention, superficial questions, etc.

When I do this process I realize that there are a couple of key dream concepts with a relation to my current reality that help me understand what the dream is trying to tell me.
