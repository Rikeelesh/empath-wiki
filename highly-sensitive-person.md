<!-- TITLE: Highly Sensitive Person (HSPs)-->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Individuals whose senses are ramped right up in their sensitivity levels -->

# Introduction

The highly sensitive person has the same 5 senses other humans do, except for HSPs those senses are much more finely tuned.

So while non-HSPs might accuse HSPs of being too sensitive, they probably don't understand that HSPs have more finely attuned senses.

It would be like cutting a non-HSP and telling them to stop being so sensitive and to toughen up. Or to play loud music in a non-HSP's room, and telling them to get over it and go to sleep.
