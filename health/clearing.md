## Clearing a space/room

### Smudging

> things like smudging and other such practices are hard bc you have to have at least a minimal sense of what you need to do beyond simply lighting the smudge stick and waving it around...it's the focus/energy and imagination work you do "behind" the smudging that is the true work of the cleansing...the smudge stick may have its own beneficial properties in awakening senses, clearing unwanted things but it can't do it on its own, if that makes sense. the person doing the smudging needs to be pretty deeply focused on the ritual at hand as well for the best results.
