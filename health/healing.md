# Signs of unhealed trauma

1. You’re hurting yourself

self-harm, cutting, drug abuse, overwork

2. You’re hurting others, or lashing out with anger when you least expect it.

“Hurt people hurt people.” aka projection

3. You’re struggling with depression, anxiety, or another serious mental health concern

Depression is anger turned inward. Anxiety is what happens when we cut ourselves off from our feelings and our energy bounces back and forth between our internal walls.

4. You avoid certain places, objects, or people you used to love, because they trigger terrible feelings.

5. You have significant gaps in your memory, particularly surrounding difficult times.

6. You can’t bear to sit alone in silence

Yet the paradoxical truth is that time in silence can actually help us to heal. Once we learn how to act as our own compassionate witness, we can let our pain arise and also let it go.

7. You have certain “shameful” stories you’d never share with anyone.

The way we stop our shame stories from running our lives is not to bury them further, but rather to share them with a kind, present witness who can help us to offer ourselves compassion and forgiveness. That’s how we rise above the toxic mix of shame and addiction.

8. Your inner dialogue is characterized by harsh criticism.

# Strategies for healing

## Talk to someone

Someone that can just be present and be there for you, without judgement and advice. Just being there for you.

## EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique)

This a technique that uses acupressure to release blocked energies from our system, which in turn release blocked emotions.

### Points

The collar bone point..

The junction where the sternum (breastbone), collarbone and the first rib meet. This is a very important point and in acupuncture is referred to as K (kidney) 27. To locate it, first place your forefinger on the U-shaped notch at the top of the breastbone (about where a man would knot his tie). From the bottom of the U, move your forefinger down toward the navel 1 inch and then go to the left (or right) 1 inch. This point is referred to as Collar Bone even though it is not on the collarbone (or clavicle) per se.

## Anxiety

Try colouring in :)
## Time

Time does heal. If you're feeling awful, give it a few days before you do anything drastic about it. It's amazing how much can shift from creating some time and space for yourself. Things do pass.
## Crystals

Place a quartz crystal on the energetic wound, relax and lie down and simply let it do it's work for you.

## Journal

Get it out onto paper whatever is going on for you. [Even Eminem used writing instead of therapy](https://youtu.be/Ji5I03sko8s?t=787); "my best therapy is to get stuff out".

## Reflexology
